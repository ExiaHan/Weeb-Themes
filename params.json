{"name":"Weeb-Themes","tagline":"The Theme Laboratory","body":"### Project Description:\r\nThis project has a variety of themes available for your use. At times, it will have some placeholder themes (why are gtk themes so hard to understand) as I learn how to make them in my spare time. The end goal is to have a complete suite of uniform themes for most, if not all, of the programs that I use.\r\n\r\n### Available Themes:\r\n![SDDM Theme IllyaDance](/images/illyadance.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Installation:\r\nClone the git repository to your local system and then copy them to the correct locations. There is also an optional script that copies everything to the correct locations in /usr, thus requires sudo permissions.\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/jurassicplayer/Weeb-Themes.git\r\n    $ cd Weeb-Themes\r\n    $ sudo ./install.sh","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
