=============

A Weeaboo's Repository for Miscellaneous Things

This repository contains four SDDM themes and a work-in-progress gtk theme.
For your convenience, an "install script" is included...aka, it's just a cp line.
Remember to grant root access via sudo or su. You can look at the script "in-depth"
if you are afraid of something malicious.

SDDM themes depend on:
- qt5-multimedia
- gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg (.mp4)
- gstreamer0.10-good-plugins (.webm, autoaudiosink)
- gstreamer0.10-base-plugins (.ogg)
