=============

A Weeaboo's Repository for Miscellaneous Things

This repository contains SDDM/KSplash themes and a work-in-progress gtk theme.
For your convenience, an "install script" is included...aka, it's just a cp line.
In theory, it will ask for sudo to dump the files into /usr/share/<place>. You can
look at the script "in-depth" if you are afraid of something malicious.

SDDM themes depend on:
- qt5-multimedia
- gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg (.mp4)
- gstreamer0.10-good-plugins (.webm, autoaudiosink)
- gstreamer0.10-base-plugins (.ogg)

KSplash themes depend on:
- qtquick
